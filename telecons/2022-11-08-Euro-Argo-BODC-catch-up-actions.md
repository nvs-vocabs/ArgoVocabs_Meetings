3| 10| Euro-Argo, BODC| At ADMT-23, ask for volunteers to join the AVTT team. In particular, we are looking for somebody to be editor of the configuration parameter names table. Also, check that current editors are still happy with their role| 
5| 11| Euro-Argo| Check with OceanOps whether he'll be contributing to ADMT re: the unconstrained fields| 
6| 12| BODC, Euro-Argo| How are legacy terms treated?	| Deprecated terms are still visible on the NVS, and are clearly marked with a 'Deprecated' sign, visible also under 'notes'. Example: http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/R11/current/11/. In VocPrez, both current and deprecated terms are visible: http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/R11/current/ (see ID 10 and 11). This distinction also exists in a machine-readable format too: http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/R11/current/11/?_profile=nvs&_mediatype=text/turtle. If a term is deprecated and is replaced by a new one, 'isReplacedBy' can also be added to link to the new term.
