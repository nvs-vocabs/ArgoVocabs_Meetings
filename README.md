# ArgoVocabs_Meetings
Agenda and minutes of meetings on Argo vocabularies

This repository contains agendas, minutes, and other materials from meetings related to Argo vocabularies as part of the [Argo Vocabulary Task Team (AVTT)](https://github.com/orgs/nvs-vocabs/teams/avtt) activities.

There two kinds of meetings:

1. **Argo Vocabulary Task Team meetings** - We hope to have two to three AVTT meetings each year.

2. **Ad-hoc teleconferences** - We occasionally have ad-hoc calls on specific topics.

    If you would like a meeting on a specific topic, please [create an issue] (https://github.com/nvs-vocabs/ArgoVocabs_Meetings/issues/new) in this repository to request one.  
    Be sure to tag people you think would be interested.
